# Contributing

This file covers development setup, test conventions, how to contribute a capture from
your own inverter, and the release checklist. `siseli_local_bridge/DOCS.md` covers
installation and configuration for users -- Home Assistant renders it on the add-on's
**Documentation** tab, so it must never carry a version literal or it becomes a fifth
place for the version to drift. `README.md` is the project's landing page.

Keep this file current — a stale entry here is worse than none, because it is trusted.

## Development setup

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install -r siseli_local_bridge/requirements.txt
```

`scapy` needs libpcap headers (`sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).
Without scapy installed, `core.py` cannot be imported and its tests will error.

Note the runtime import root is `siseli_local_bridge/`, so the top-level package is
literally `src` and modules are imported as `src.siseli_local_bridge.*`. That mirrors how
the add-on starts (`python3 -m src.siseli_local_bridge.core` from `/app`) and is why
`pyproject.toml` declares `package-dir` explicitly — auto-discovery finds nothing,
because `siseli_local_bridge/` has no `__init__.py`.

## Running the checks

```bash
pytest siseli_local_bridge/tests -q
ruff check .
```

Coverage floors, matching CI:

```bash
pytest siseli_local_bridge/tests --cov=siseli_local_bridge/src --cov-report=
python -m coverage report --fail-under=78
python -m coverage report --include="*/siseli_local_bridge/mqtt.py,*/siseli_local_bridge/core.py" --fail-under=65
```

A smoke test starts the built image and waits for it to report a running sniffer:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Run it before releasing. Two releases shipped broken because "the image builds" and
"the tests pass" were both true of an add-on that could not start: the startup banner
lives in the `__main__` body that no test executes, in a file carrying a ruff `F405`
exemption. Only starting the container catches that class of fault.

`ruff check` runs a deliberately narrow, defect-only rule set (pyflakes, bugbear,
syntax errors). There is no formatter and none is wanted: reformatting would rewrite
~2,500 lines in one commit and destroy `git blame` on the parser, which is where the
project's hard-won knowledge lives.

## Writing tests

Tests are `unittest.TestCase` throughout; pytest is only the runner. Shared
machinery lives in two modules:

- **`tests/helpers.py`** — behaviour: `BASE_ENV`/`patched_env`, `reload_config`,
  `patch_consts`, `isolated_state`, `capture_logs`, `FakeMqttClient`, and builders
  for MQTT packets, TCP segments and inverter payload envelopes.
- **`tests/captures.py`** — data only, no imports, no logic.

Two rules that are easy to get wrong:

1. **Patch config constants on the *consuming* module.** `core.py`, `mqtt.py` and
   `parsers.py` all do `from .config import *`, so they hold bound copies. Reloading
   `config.py` does not change them. Use
   `patch_consts("src.siseli_local_bridge.parsers", INVERTER_COUNT=2)`.
2. **Wrap anything that touches module globals in `isolated_state()`.** `LAST_STATE`,
   `FLOW_STATES`, `LAST_ENERGY_TS` and friends leak between tests otherwise, and the
   failure shows up as an unrelated test failing depending on run order.

Some tests are marked `CURRENT BEHAVIOUR` in their docstring. Those pin a known
defect deliberately, so that fixing it shows up as a reviewed diff rather than a
silent change. If one fails because you fixed the underlying bug, update the test in
the same commit and say so.

## Adding a capture from a user's inverter

This is the highest-value contribution for supporting a new device.

1. Ask the reporter to set **Debug Flags** to `blocks` and `unparsed_publish`, with
   **Log Level** at `info`, for **two minutes**, then clear the flags again. Output is
   per-packet and lands on the SD card. (`LOG_LEVEL: debug` also works but floods the
   log with everything else; the flags select exactly the lines you need. The issue
   template, `captures/README.md` and the Documentation tab all say flags + `info`.)
2. Ask for the `[BLOCK RAW]` lines. Have them scrub the `topic=` values (the Siseli
   cloud topic embeds the device serial) and `firmware_info` if they prefer.
3. Take the `hex_preview` field, decode it, and paste the result into
   `tests/captures.py` verbatim as a `BLOCK_*` constant. The framing is exact: a
   leading `(` and a trailing `\r`, no closing paren.
4. Record the model and firmware in a comment, and name the constant after the block
   key plus the device state it was captured in.

A capture worth keeping as *reference* rather than as a fixture goes in
[`captures/`](captures/) instead — a full comparison of the bridge's decode against the
vendor portal, read at the same moment. [`captures/README.md`](captures/README.md) has
the procedure and a table of which device states would settle which open questions.
Fixtures prove the parser does not regress; reference captures are the only way to find
a field that is *wrong* rather than merely missing.

Hand-built blocks go under `SYNTH_*` and must never be used for value-parity
assertions — a synthetic block proves nothing about what a device actually emits.

## Releasing

The version has one source of truth and two copies of it, because Supervisor reads
`config.yaml` directly and cannot import Python:

- `siseli_local_bridge/src/siseli_local_bridge/version.py` — the source of truth
- `siseli_local_bridge/config.yaml` — what Supervisor reads
- the README badge and the changelog heading

Nothing else may carry a version literal. `run.sh` used to print one and it froze two
releases behind, so every add-on log contradicted the banner `core.py` prints seconds
later — and a maintainer triaging a pasted log diagnosed the wrong release.
`test_packaging.py` now forbids it there outright.

`tests/test_packaging.py` fails until those two, the README badge, and the heading at
the top of the add-on changelog all agree. The failure mode it exists to prevent is
asymmetric: if `config.yaml` lags, Supervisor never offers the update while the log
claims the new version is running.

A release is a single commit touching: `siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md` (the canonical
one -- the root file is just a pointer), `version.py`, `config.yaml`, and the README
badge.

Changelog entries follow Keep a Changelog: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, then
`### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed`, with bullets shaped
