# Architecture

Anchors: a bare `core.py:N` means `siseli_local_bridge/src/siseli_local_bridge/core.py`; `tests/x.py:N` means `siseli_local_bridge/tests/x.py`. Line numbers are for 2.6.19 (commit `2851d8e`).

`TestArchitectureDocAnchors` in `siseli_local_bridge/tests/test_packaging.py` checks these: every cited file must exist, every line must be inside it, and wherever the prose names a backticked symbol before a citation, that symbol must be defined on the cited line. What it cannot check is a citation pointing at a statement rather than a definition — roughly half of them — so treat those as approximate and re-read before relying on one. Half the anchors here had drifted within a day of first being written, which is why the test exists.

## What this is

A Home Assistant add-on that ARP-spoofs a Siseli-platform solar inverter and its router so both send their frames through the bridge (`core.py:172-207`).
It passively reassembles the inverter's TCP stream to the vendor MQTT cloud (`parsers.py:505`), extracts the MQTT PUBLISH packets (`parsers.py:363`), and decodes the base64 "blocks" inside each one into sensor values (`parsers.py:1274`).
Values merge into one shared dict (`state.py:12`) and are republished to the local broker under HA MQTT auto-discovery (`mqtt.py:124`, `mqtt.py:278`).
Every captured frame is re-emitted to its real destination (`core.py:320-325`, `core.py:355-360`), so the vendor app keeps working.
The bridge observes; it never terminates or answers a connection. Only the inverter-to-cloud direction is parsed; cloud-to-inverter is forwarded untouched (`core.py:348-360`).
Block positions were reverse-engineered from one device with no schema, so the governing rule of the parser is: publish a value only when this payload contains evidence for it.

## Top-level layout

| Path | What it is | One non-obvious fact |
|---|---|---|
| `siseli_local_bridge/` | The add-on: Docker build context, manifest, runtime, tests | It is the *only* thing that reaches the image (`siseli_local_bridge/Dockerfile:24` `COPY . .`, `scripts/smoke-test.sh:30`); root-level docs and `captures/` never ship |
| `siseli_local_bridge/src/siseli_local_bridge/` | The runtime, eight modules | The package path is `src.siseli_local_bridge` because `run.sh:46` execs `python3 -m src.siseli_local_bridge.core`; tests patch `src.siseli_local_bridge.<module>` |
| `siseli_local_bridge/tests/` | 11 test files, `helpers.py`, `captures.py`, `conftest.py` | Excluded from the image (`siseli_local_bridge/.dockerignore:10`); `conftest.py` puts `siseli_local_bridge/` on `sys.path` so imports mirror the runtime path |
| `siseli_local_bridge/config.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `run.sh`, `requirements.txt`, `.dockerignore`, `icon.png`, `logo.png` | Add-on manifest and build inputs | `config.yaml` has no `image:` key and there is no `build.yaml`, so Supervisor builds locally from the Dockerfile (`tests/test_packaging.py:428-433`) |
| `siseli_local_bridge/DOCS.md`, `siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md` | The HA Documentation tab and Changelog tab | Only `CHANGELOG.md` ships in the image (`.dockerignore:28-29`); Supervisor reads `DOCS.md` from the repo checkout |
| `siseli_local_bridge/translations/en.yaml` | UI labels for every option | Its key set must equal the schema's (`tests/test_packaging.py:94`) |
| `.github/` | CI workflow, dependabot, issue and PR templates | The seven CI check names are branch-protection requirements on `main`; nothing in the checkout says so except `tests/test_packaging.py:263-305` |
| `scripts/smoke-test.sh` | Build the image and wait for a running sniffer | Bypasses `run.sh` (`:46` overrides the entrypoint) and runs with `AUTO_INTERCEPT=false` (`:39`), so no ARP frame is ever sent under CI |
| `captures/` | Paired bridge-log / vendor-portal readings of the same device at the same second | `tests/captures.py` proves the parser does not regress; `captures/` is the only evidence that a decode is *correct* (`captures/README.md:19-24`) |
| `sensor_mapping_verified.md`, `sensor_mapping.md` | Per-token decode map for HPVINV04; the superseded 2.6.0 map | The verified file supersedes its own tables: Section 0 (`:25-124`) is the simultaneous reading, the later tables were 17 minutes apart (`:18-21`) |
| `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | GitHub landing page, dev procedure, security posture, conduct | `README.md` may use relative links; `DOCS.md` may not (`tests/test_packaging.py:227-234`). `SECURITY.md:30-32` states that a wrong `INVERTER_IP` poisons the wrong host by design |
| `CHANGELOG.md` (root) | A nine-line pointer | Must not carry any `## [N` heading (`tests/test_packaging.py:51-56`); the canonical history is `siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md` |
| `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` | MIT; scope statement | Upstream `yuraantonov11/siseli-ha` carries no licence, so the MIT grant covers only work done here (`NOTICE:3-16`) |
| `pyproject.toml`, `repository.yaml` | Dev/CI packaging; the add-on repository manifest | `pyproject.toml:30-36` declares the top-level package as literally `src` because `siseli_local_bridge/` has no `__init__.py` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Local agent notes | Untracked by design (`.gitignore:39`) |
| `docs/` | This file | Not read by any test |

```

Non-broker inverter traffic is counted in `DROPPED_NON_TARGET` and forwarded only when `FORWARD_ALL_INVERTER_TRAFFIC` is set and the frame was L2-addressed to us (`core.py:181`).

### Threads and the lock

`CLAUDE.md` says three threads; there are five threads of execution, three of which touch `LAST_STATE`.

| Thread | Started | Touches `LAST_STATE` | Flags it writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| main | `core.py:617-618` sleep loop | before other threads exist (`:140`, `:587-588`) | `RUNNING`, `AVAILABILITY_ONLINE` via `shutdown` (`:518-542`) |
| ARP spoofer (daemon) | `core.py:536`, only when `AUTO_INTERCEPT` | no; reads `_state.RUNNING` (`:179`, `:200`) | none |
| scapy `AsyncSniffer` | `core.py:536` | sole runtime writer (`parsers.py:1971`) | `LAST_TELEMETRY_TS`, `TELEMETRY_INTERVALS`, `PUBLISHED_SENSOR_KEYS`, once-logged flags |
| paho network | `mqtt.py:323` `loop_start` | reads via `snapshot_state` (`mqtt.py:74`, `:298`) | `DISCOVERY_PUBLISHED` (`:175`), `PUBLISHED_SENSOR_KEYS` (`:164`); re-asserts `AVAILABILITY_ONLINE` (`:174`) |
| `health_logger` (daemon) | `core.py:601` | reads via `republish_state` -> `snapshot_state` (`:462-463`, `parsers.py:640`) | `AVAILABILITY_ONLINE` (`:436`) |

`STATE_LOCK` is an `RLock` (`state.py:21`) held only inside `snapshot_state` and `update_state` (`:75-85`), never across I/O. The comment at `state.py:85` records why: a dict resize during `on_connect` iteration killed the paho thread silently. `health_logger` ticks every 10 s (`core.py:512`), runs the watchdog each tick (`:454`), republishes retained state when `heartbeat_due` (`parsers.py:625`, interval `max(UPDATE_INTERVAL_SEC, EXPIRE_AFTER_SEC//3)` = 600 s at defaults), and prints `[HEALTH]` every third tick (`:467-469`). Availability is keyed on decoded telemetry (`state.py:32`, `core.py:411`), not on packet age, with a timeout of `max(TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT_SEC, min(3 x observed gap, 3600))` (`core.py:372-399`) and a startup grace measured from `PROCESS_START_TS` (`:412-415`).

### How configuration reaches the modules

```
Supervisor options -> run.sh:3-40  export X="$(bashio::config 'X' 'default')"
                   -> config.py:9-95  os.getenv at import
                   -> core.py:24 and mqtt.py:7   from .config import *        (bound copies)
                      parsers.py:11-20           from .config import (...)    (explicit list; still bound copies)
                      loggers.py:24              level bound at import
```

Consequences:

- Tests must patch the **consuming** module (`tests/helpers.py:98` `patch_consts`); reloading `config.py` changes nothing the runtime reads.
- Names starting with `_` are not exported by a star import. `core.py` and `mqtt.py` carry a ruff `F405` exemption (`pyproject.toml:64-66`), so a reference to one is caught by neither lint nor tests; `tests/test_core.py:577-600` greps for it, and the smoke test exists because this crash-looped a release. `config.py:146-147` defines `ACTIVE_DEBUG_FLAGS` for exactly this reason. `parsers.py` never had a star import despite the exemption at `pyproject.toml:66`.
- `validate_config` (`config.py:200`) is called only from `__main__` (`core.py:581-582`) and `sys.exit`s on error, so importing `config` in tests never aborts.
- Not env-driven: `STATE_CACHE_FILE` (`config.py:5`), `STATE_CACHE_INTERVAL_SEC` (`:162`), the reassembly bounds (`:167-175`). Read from env but deliberately not add-on options: `TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER`, `TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT_CEILING_SEC`, `ENERGY_MAX_DT_SEC` (`:76-92`), because Supervisor pins a stored option forever and a default is not a fix.
- The state module is aliased two ways: `_state` in `core.py:27` and `mqtt.py:6`, `_shared_state` in `parsers.py:8`. Grep for both when tracing a flag.

## Tests and evidence

**Fixture contract** (`tests/captures.py:1-11`): `BLOCK_*` are verbatim bytes from a real device, reconstructed from a `[BLOCK RAW]` `hex_preview`, and may back golden assertions; `SYNTH_*` are hand-built and may only back structural or edge tests. Device A (HPVINV04, two parallel units, 32-cell bank) supplies `CAPTURE_TELEMETRY` (11 blocks, `:48-60`) and `CAPTURE_IDENTITY` (4 blocks, `:62-67`), which have zero overlap (`:22-24`); together they cover all 15 names in `KNOWN_BLOCK_NAMES` (`parsers.py:122`), which `tests/test_truthfulness.py:709-721` pins against the decoder's own source via `inspect.getsource`. `EXPECTED_*` golden dicts (`:69-139`) were taken from the add-on's own "Published to HA" line and are asserted key-for-key at `tests/test_truthfulness.py:554-574`. Two different devices are both labelled "Device B" (`:142` reference unit, `:155` Beve Mega foreign device); the `*_REF` literals at `:147-152` end in `)` rather than `\r` and were not built per the contract.

**Isolation helper**: `helpers.isolated_state` (`tests/helpers.py:121-167`) saves and restores 17 module globals across `parsers.py` and `state.py`, including every once-logged flag. It does **not** cover `core.py` globals (`INV_MAC`, `KNOWN_*_MACS`, `LAST_PACKET_TS`, `DROPPED_NON_TARGET`), `state.RUNNING` or `state.DISCOVERY_CLEANED`; `test_core._CoreTestCase` (`tests/test_core.py:44-93`) restores those by hand. `BASE_ENV` (`:22-57`) is pinned to `config.yaml` by `tests/test_packaging.py:645-676` because `reload_config` (`:73`) reloads `config.py` in place and never restores it; `tests/test_packaging.py:645-649` records the order-dependent false pass that caused. `FakeMqttClient` (`:176`) records publishes, retained topics and the will.

**Coverage**: 323 tests + 1132 subtests, ~7 s. Measured 84 % overall and 74 % for `mqtt.py`+`core.py` against floors of 78 and 65 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:46-47`); the "~2 points under" comment at `:43-44` is stale. `core.py` alone sits at 65 %, carried by `mqtt.py` at 94 %; nothing gates `core.py` individually.

**What only the smoke test proves**: the `__main__` body (`core.py:580-622`), `start_mqtt` (`mqtt.py:393-325`), and that the image starts at all. **What nothing proves**: the ARP send path (`core.py:172-207`, `:50-54`, always mocked at `tests/test_core.py:63-68`, disabled in smoke at `scripts/smoke-test.sh:39`); `SIGTERM -> shutdown` (`core.py:572-577` is only asserted callable at `tests/test_core.py:373-374`, and smoke tears down with `docker rm -f`, `scripts/smoke-test.sh:25`); the `health_logger` loop body (`core.py:601`); `run.sh` itself (entrypoint overridden at `scripts/smoke-test.sh:46`; only grepped by `tests/test_packaging.py:97-100`). One test is vacuous: `tests/test_core.py:309-314` patches `core.client` but `shutdown` publishes through `mqtt.py`'s own client (`core.py:694` -> `mqtt.py:179-181`), so the `except` at `core.py:536` never runs.

**Source-as-data tests**: five tests parse source text rather than executing it and will fail on a purely stylistic rewrite: `tests/test_sensors.py:147-190` (regex over `parsers.py` for `state["key"] =`), `tests/test_core.py:577-600`, `tests/test_truthfulness.py:709-721`, `tests/test_packaging.py:285-305` (ci.yml -> check names), `tests/test_packaging.py:102-105` (`os.getenv("KEY"` literals).

**`captures/`**: three reference captures. `2026-08-21_1341_charging.md` (2.6.10, 202 parameters, none disagree); `2026-08-21_2341_discharging.md` (2.6.15, same device ten hours later, refutes three candidate decodes at `:66-86`); `2026-08-22_device-b-modbus.md` (issue #30, binary Modbus RTU inside the same DTU envelope, not a decode). `captures/README.md:36-51` lists which device states would settle which open question; every flag has read its safe value in every capture so far.

## Packaging and CI

**How HA installs it**: the user adds the repo URL; Supervisor reads `repository.yaml` and `siseli_local_bridge/config.yaml`. With no `image:` key and no `build.yaml` (`tests/test_packaging.py:428-433`), Supervisor builds `siseli_local_bridge/Dockerfile` on the user's machine: `ARG BUILD_FROM=ghcr.io/hassio-addons/base:14.0.0` (`:1-2`, a multi-arch manifest, which is what makes a local aarch64 build work), `apk add python3 py3-pip libpcap-dev dos2unix iproute2` (`:14`), `COPY . .` (`:24`), `dos2unix run.sh` (`:27`, the only CRLF defence), `CMD ["./run.sh"]` (`:29`). `run.sh` turns every option into an env var and `exec`s Python (`:46`) so signals reach `core.py`'s handlers; `init: false` (`config.yaml:6`). Privileges: `host_network`, `NET_ADMIN`+`NET_RAW`, `apparmor: false` (`config.yaml:10-14`; reasons in `SECURITY.md:45-50`).

**Supervisor pins stored options.** Every option's value is stored the first time the user saves the configuration page and shadows the shipped default forever (`config.py:76-79`). Supervisor also validates *stored* options against the *new* schema before an update, so removing an option or tightening a pattern blocks the upgrade; a trailing `?` means the key may be absent, not that `''` passes (`tests/test_packaging.py:570-642` replays a real stored configuration). `LISTEN_PORT` and `LOG_VERBOSE` therefore stay in the schema and are read only to warn (`config.py:157`, `:279-291`; `tests/test_packaging.py:474-502`).

**The six-place option rule.** A new option touches `config.yaml` `options:` (`:16`) and `schema:` (`:56`), `translations/en.yaml`, `run.sh` (`bashio::config 'KEY'`), `config.py` (`os.getenv("KEY"`), and `DOCS.md` as a backticked `KEY`. `tests/test_packaging.py:81-105` pins the first five and `:209-215` the sixth. There is effectively a seventh: `tests/helpers.py` `BASE_ENV` (`tests/test_packaging.py:670-676`). `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md:21-23` still says five.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): five jobs, seven check runs.

| Job | Runner | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| `test` (`:10`) | `ubuntu-latest` x Python 3.9/3.11/3.12 (`:13-14`) | `test (3.9)`, `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`; coverage floors at `:46-47` |
| `lint` (`:58`) | `ubuntu-latest` | `lint` (`ruff check .`) |
| `addon-lint` (`:75`) | `ubuntu-latest` | `addon-lint` via `frenck/action-app-linter@v2` (`:85`; renamed from action-addon-linter, warnings do not fail) |
| `smoke` (`:92`) | `ubuntu-24.04` / `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (`:104-110`), `fail-fast: false` | `smoke (amd64, ubuntu-24.04)`, `smoke (aarch64, ubuntu-24.04-arm)`; runs `scripts/smoke-test.sh` (`:119`) |

There is no separate docker build job; smoke builds first (`:98`). **Branch protection on `main` requires exactly those seven check names**, derived by GitHub from job id plus every matrix value, so bumping `runner: ubuntu-24.04` alone renames a check and blocks every PR with no error naming the cause. `tests/test_packaging.py:263-305` pins the derived set; the protection rule must be edited in the same change.

**Pins are written twice**: `pyproject.toml:17-20` (what CI installs) and `siseli_local_bridge/requirements.txt` (what the image installs) must agree, and `Dockerfile:1` must equal `scripts/smoke-test.sh:18` (`tests/test_packaging.py:436-471`). Dependabot is registered for both pip roots and for docker (`.github/dependabot.yml:8-26`), so each single-file bot PR fails CI until a human lands the pair; this is the documented intent.

**Version** lives in four files that must agree in one commit: `version.py:7`, `config.yaml:3`, the `README.md:3` badge, and the first `## [x.y.z]` heading in `siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md` (`tests/test_packaging.py:24-50`). `run.sh` may not print one (`:57-67`).

## Documentation

The split is by render target, not topic (`CONTRIBUTING.md:3-7`): `README.md` is the GitHub landing page only; `siseli_local_bridge/DOCS.md` is what Supervisor renders on the add-on's Documentation tab; `CONTRIBUTING.md` is developer procedure. It was created in 2.6.13 by reversing 2.5.0, which had merged `DOCS.md` into the README and left the tab empty (`siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md:155-160`).

Tests holding it (`tests/test_packaging.py`):

| Pair | Test | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| README <-> DOCS.md | `TestDocumentationSplit` (`:177-234`) | Requirements/Installation/Configuration/Network setup/Troubleshooting live only in DOCS.md; README has no option table rows; README names DOCS.md |
| DOCS.md <-> config.yaml | `:209-215` | every schema key appears backticked |
| DOCS.md alone | `:220-234` | no *current* version literal (earlier ones allowed); every link is `http(s)` or `#anchor`, because a relative link resolves against the HA origin inside the frontend |
| README <-> sensor registry | `TestDocumentedCountsAreCurrent` (`:237-261`) | "207 sensors", "143 enabled", "45 of the 207" are derived from `SENSORS` and `UNDECODED_SENSOR_KEYS` |
| root CHANGELOG <-> add-on CHANGELOG | `:41-56` | root is a pointer with no headings; the add-on file's first heading equals `version.py` |

Nothing tests `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the per-device counts in `DOCS.md:164-172`, or any option *description*. Known stale text: `DOCS.md:179-180` says "three kWh counters" and `translations/en.yaml:91` says battery and grid totals, while `core.py:63-69` resets five; `tests/captures.py:13` still says to ask reporters for `LOG_LEVEL: debug` while every other place says Debug Flags at info; `sensor_mapping_verified.md:375` and `:388` still name the `eo8w[1]`/`Yavb[1]` candidates that `captures/2026-08-21_2341_discharging.md:66-86` refuted.

## The 10 biggest risks and half-finished areas

**1. The sniffer thread can die silently while ARP poisoning continues, blackholing the inverter.**
`core.py:612-614` starts the `AsyncSniffer` and logs `[Bridge] Sniffer started` unconditionally; the main loop at `:617-618` polls only `_state.RUNNING`, and nothing in `src/` reads `sniffer.running` or `sniffer.exception`. In the installed scapy 2.6.1 the capture socket is opened inside the sniffer thread, and a recv error *or* an exception escaping `packet_callback` closes the socket and ends the thread with `exception` still `None`; the only report goes to the `scapy.runtime` logger, which `core.py:310` sets to ERROR. `ArpSpoofer.run` (`:200-207`) keeps poisoning every 2 s on `_state.RUNNING` alone, and forwarding exists only inside `packet_callback` (`:320-325`, `:355-360`), so the inverter loses its cloud path until a manual restart. `health_logger` (`:447-483`) prints packet age and takes no action; the watchdog flips availability only after 1800-3600 s (`:433-437`), and Supervisor's Watchdog (`DOCS.md:66`) reacts to container exit only.
Status: **FIXED in 2.6.20.** The health loop checks capture liveness every 10 s, restarts a
dead sniffer in place, and after three consecutive failures restores ARP and exits non-zero.
Kept here because the first attempt at the fix called `shutdown()` from the daemon health
thread, where the interpreter killed it mid-restore — the reusable lesson is that a teardown
which needs a second of wall time has to run on the main thread.
Fix: have `health_logger` or the main loop check `sniffer.running` and either restart the sniffer or clear `RUNNING` so the container exits and Supervisor restarts it. The smoke test cannot catch this; its ready marker is the same log line (`scripts/smoke-test.sh:20`).

**2. The `INVERTER_COUNT` scaling basis is unproven.**
`_scale_main_power` (`parsers.py:1230`) multiplies load, mains and generation power by `INVERTER_COUNT` (`:1316`, `:1387`, `:1581`), the factor also enters grid import (`:863`) and the legacy battery current (`:744`, `:768`), and all of it feeds five monotonic kWh counters (`:772-778`) that persist across restarts (`:1974` -> `core.py:140`). Whether the inverter's blocks carry per-unit or system figures is recorded as the top open question in `captures/README.md:64-66` and `captures/2026-08-21_2341_discharging.md:108-122`, yet `DOCS.md:209` says "per-unit figures" flatly and `siseli_local_bridge/CHANGELOG.md:259` calls the 11 kW nameplate confirmed. The proposed 24-hour `c_generation_energy_kwh` vs `pv_today_kwh` ratio (`CHANGELOG.md:237`) cannot discriminate, because both derive from the same device's blocks (`parsers.py:1572-1581`, `:1187-1188`). The shipped default `INVERTER_COUNT: 1` (`config.yaml:38`) is unaffected, and the night-time efficiency figure (89.6 %) leans the code's way.
Status: **open question — still open.** The docs no longer state the basis as fact (2.6.19); the
question itself is unresolved and only a rating plate or a clamp meter settles it.
Settle: a rating-plate photo or a clamp-meter reading on the maintainer's install at night with PV = 0; soften `DOCS.md:209` until then.

**3. Battery-current guards reject anything over 300 A, below the BMS's own 390 A limit, and say nothing.**
`parsers.py:1468` and `:1473` (2ONL) and `:1769`, `:1771` (Yavb) drop currents outside `0..300` with no log, while the same device reports `bms_charge_current_limit_a = 390` (`captures/2026-08-21_2341_discharging.md:27`). A rejected reading leaves its key absent, `[ENERGY SOURCE DISAGREEMENT]` fires only when *both* sources are present (`:743`), and `_battery_current` silently uses the survivor (`:765-768`), which on the reference install is the scaled inverter ammeter that the captures show disagreeing with the BMS by 1.6x to ~10x. If both are absent, charge/discharge power become 0 (`:837-846`) and `battery_status` reads `Idle` (`:795-800`). The only test of the guard uses 9999 A (`tests/captures.py:220`, `tests/test_truthfulness.py:299-304`).
Status: **FIXED in 2.6.21.** The bound is 1000 A, clear of the 390 A the hardware
declares for itself, and a rejection now logs once as `[BATTERY CURRENT REJECTED]`.
Fix: raise the bound to a physical ceiling or the device's declared limit, and log the rejection once, as the grid guard does at `:1396`.

**4. An unreachable broker logs nothing, while every payload still prints "Published to HA".**
`mqtt.py:322-323` uses `connect_async` + `loop_start`; paho 1.6.1 (`requirements.txt:1`) retries forever and reports connect failure only through `on_connect_fail` or `on_log`, which nothing in `src/` sets. `on_connect` (`:288`) needs a CONNACK, so the `rc != 0` branch at `:302` covers bad credentials only. `parse_payload`'s "Published to HA" line (`parsers.py:1955`) sits outside the `DISCOVERY_PUBLISHED` gate (`:1987`), so it prints when nothing was published; `health_logger` prints no client state (`core.py:512`); `DOCS.md:322-323` tells the user a failed connection means wrong credentials.
Status: **FIXED in 2.6.21.** `on_connect_fail` is registered, `publish_grouped_state`
returns whether the broker accepted the publish, the per-payload line reports which of
three things happened, and the health line opens with `broker=up`/`broker=DOWN`.
Fix: register `on_connect_fail`, print `client.is_connected()` in the `[HEALTH]` line, and gate the "Published" line on an actual publish.

**5. Grid import has never been captured non-zero, and its label and integrator consult different sources.**
Import is integrated only when WdRR[6] is positive (`parsers.py:862-863`) and feeds a monotonic `total_increasing` counter (`:868-870`, `sensors.py:70`); every recorded token is `+00000` (`captures/README.md:48`, `captures/2026-08-21_1341_charging.md:347`), yet the reference install carries 56 kWh of import (`captures/2026-08-21_1341_charging.md:114`). Git shows the `> 0` rule unchanged since the counter was introduced (`2d8b3e6`), so the token has been positive at some point, presumably below the 35 % return-to-mains SOC (`captures/2026-08-21_1341_charging.md:68`) that neither capture reached. The direction label is decided by the flow code before the sign is read (`:1153-1161`): running the parser with token `-01500` and code `0` yields "Mains To Inverter" and 0 W, so label and integrator can contradict.
Status: open question (sign convention unverified) with one demonstrable inconsistency.
Settle: a capture on grid with SOC below the return threshold; until then make the label and the integrator read the same source.

**6. A pinned `SNIFF_IFACE` on a dual-homed host stamps ARP replies and forwarded frames with the wrong MAC.**
`core.py:202-203` builds `Ether(dst)/ARP(op=2, ...)` with no `hwsrc` and no `Ether.src`; forwarded frames at `:322`, `:342`, `:357` likewise; `send_layer2` (`:50-54`) passes `iface` only to `sendp`, which selects the send socket and rewrites nothing. scapy fills the source fields from the interface its routing table picks for the *destination IP*, not from `iface`; executing the exact frame from `:202` confirms it. `DOCS.md:101` and `:328` recommend pinning `SNIFF_IFACE` precisely on hosts where capture is not seeing traffic, i.e. multi-homed ones. No test sends an unmocked frame (`tests/test_core.py:63-68`) and smoke runs `AUTO_INTERCEPT=false`.
Status: live defect under one configuration; end-to-end effect on a real dual-homed HA host unverified.
Fix: set `hwsrc` and `Ether.src` explicitly from `resolve_own_mac()` (`:151`), which already reads `SNIFF_IFACE`'s MAC for the own-frame guard (`:291-292`).

**7. The unsupported-protocol diagnostic mis-triages an ASCII device as binary (issue #32).**
`_describe_foreign_blocks` (`parsers.py:1027`) labels a body `binary` if any byte fails the printable test (`:931-934`, `:955`). Issue #32 (Falcon VMIII 4200W on 2.6.17) reports `recognised=0 body="binary"`; running the function on its 12 complete blocks, 8 fail on exactly one or two checksum bytes before `\r`, and the bodies are `(`-framed space-separated ASCII tokens, the shape `_try_ascii_schema` consumes (`:996-1011`). `DOCS.md:308` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/unsupported_inverter.yml:43-46` call `body="binary"` the strongest signal of a different protocol family. `tests/test_truthfulness.py:702-707` pins only that ASCII is not labelled Modbus.
Status: **FIXED in 2.6.18.** Bodies are classified individually as `ascii`, `ascii+binary_tail`
or `binary`, and the device is now identified as Voltronic PI30 on 22-of-22 CRC16-XMODEM
verification. Kept here because the shape of the mistake — one boolean folding two axes — is
the reusable lesson.
Fix: exclude trailing checksum bytes from the printable test and emit `looks_like="ascii_with_checksum"`; support would need a block-name map plus checksum stripping, not a second parser family.

**8. `hex_preview` truncates at 64 bytes, so the documented fixture pipeline cannot produce the fixtures.**
`parsers.py:1930` emits `blocks[name][:64].hex()` with no truncation marker; `loggers.py:70` already has a `hex_preview(limit=240)` helper with a marker that is not used here. The fixture contract (`tests/captures.py:5-8`) and `CONTRIBUTING.md:94-96` say `BLOCK_*` are decoded verbatim from that field, yet `BLOCK_93VQ_SETTINGS`, `BLOCK_DHRK_SETTINGS`, `BLOCK_YAVB_CHARGING` and `BLOCK_V09K_CELLS_16` are 70-90 bytes. The cap bit issue #30 (`captures/2026-08-22_device-b-modbus.md:36-37`) and #32 (both telemetry-bearing blocks cut at 64), and the `text=`/`tokens=` fields (`:1928-1929`) are lossy for non-ASCII tails.
Status: **FIXED in 2.6.18.** `hex_preview` is no longer capped at 64 bytes; it uses the helper in
`loggers.py` that marks truncation. The two telemetry blocks it destroyed in issue #32 still
have to be re-requested from the reporter.
Fix: call `loggers.hex_preview` or raise the cap to the full block.

**9. Energy clocks are not persisted; every restart drops one interval and a failing cache write desyncs HA.**
`LAST_ENERGY_TS` is process-local (`parsers.py:172`) and `_energy_dt_seconds` returns 0 on the first call per domain (`:679-688`), pinned as intended by `tests/test_parsers.py:205-224`. The cache holds only `LAST_STATE` (`:1974`, `core.py:140`) and `shutdown` writes none (`core.py:694`), so at the 300-600 s cadence and ~5 kW each restart silently loses 0.4-0.9 kWh per domain. If `atomic_write_json` fails, `[CACHE WRITE ERROR]` (`:632-634`) is logged but publishing continues, so the broker and `/data/state.json` diverge until a write succeeds; a torn file then restores as empty state (`tests/test_core.py:158-169`, a CURRENT BEHAVIOUR pin).
Status: **half fixed in 2.6.19.** Durations now use `time.monotonic()`, so a clock step can no
longer fabricate a block of kWh — that was the sharp edge. The clocks are still not persisted,
so each restart still drops up to one interval per domain; that part remains known and accepted.
Fix: persist the per-domain clocks next to the snapshot and clamp `dt` on restore with the existing `_energy_max_dt` (`:712-727`).

**10. `bms_cell_count` reports cells decoded from the v09K block, not cells in the pack.**
`parsers.py:722` sets `bms_cell_count = len(cell_values)`, where v09K carries at most 16 cells of a 32-cell pack (`:1237-1242`; `sensor_mapping_verified.md:235-238`), and the cell list stops at the first out-of-range token, so `tests/test_truthfulness.py:335-342` pins that a collapsed cell 3 makes the count read 2. The registry names it "BMS Cell Count" (`sensors.py:43`), and the `>16` warning at `:1256-1261` has no test. Min/max/delta come from uxJp and are pack-wide (`:1237-1241`), so only the count is wrong.
Status: live defect (a wrong-looking-right value).
Fix: rename the entity to what it measures or derive the count from uxJp's positions.

## Conventions that are load-bearing

- **Publish only what this payload evidences; one writer per key.** Every branch of `_try_ascii_schema` is `if len(vals) >= n` (`parsers.py:1408`, `:1358`, `:1454`); no defaults, no constants, no cross-block aliases. The only cross-payload reads are the `bat_v` cache fallback (`:827-829`) and previous energy totals (`:773`). Enforced by `tests/test_truthfulness.py:35-94` (no fabrication), `:97-179` (single writer), `:554-574` (golden parity).
- **Timing bounds come from measured cadence, not from another option.** `state.observed_telemetry_interval` (`state.py:55-62`) feeds both `effective_telemetry_timeout` (`core.py:405-399`) and `_energy_max_dt` (`parsers.py:752`); `UPDATE_INTERVAL_SEC` is a publish throttle and says nothing about the inverter (`config.py:68`). The measured cadence is a fixture (`tests/test_core.py:603-692`, `tests/test_truthfulness.py:394-470`).
- **A bound that fires during normal operation logs, once, and its once-flag is registered for isolation.** `[ENERGY GAP CLAMPED]` (`parsers.py:703`), `[GRID VALUE REJECTED]` (`:1396`), `[UNSUPPORTED PROTOCOL]` (`:2031`); each flag is saved and restored by `tests/helpers.py:121-167`. Add a flag without registering it and later tests inherit the fired state.
- **Shared flags live in `state.py` and are reached through the module alias.** `state.py:23-26` and `:44-52` record the two bugs that came from private copies (`RUNNING`, `AVAILABILITY_ONLINE`). Access is `_state.NAME` (`core.py:27`, `mqtt.py:6`) or `_shared_state.NAME` (`parsers.py:8`), never `from .state import NAME`. Regression pinned at `tests/test_core.py:421-485`.
- **Patch constants on the consuming module; never reference `_private` config names across a star import.** `core.py:24` and `mqtt.py:7` hold bound copies; `tests/helpers.py:98` `patch_consts` is the tool; `tests/test_core.py:577-600` greps for underscore names because `pyproject.toml:64-66` exempts `F405`.
- **Anything that must be verified lives in a module-level function called from `__main__`.** `log_startup_configuration` (`core.py:563`), `load_cached_state` (`:72`), `install_signal_handlers` (`:572`); the `__main__` body (`:580-622`) is executed by no test.
- **A removed sensor goes into `UNDECODED_SENSOR_KEYS`, never just deleted.** `/data/state.json` outlives the code and is merged wholesale at `core.py:590`; `:101-109` purges the listed keys. `tests/test_sensors.py:147-190` greps `parsers.py` to prove no listed key is written and every written key is registered, which is what makes the "not in SENSORS" purge at `core.py:121-129` safe.
- **The registry derives everything on the wire.** Group from `get_sensor_group` (`sensors.py:353`) fixes the discovery topic and `unique_id` (`mqtt.py:131`) and the state topic (`:45-50`); the value template is `{{ value_json.<key> }}` (`:136`). Regrouping a sensor orphans its HA entity (`tests/test_mqtt.py:298-303`), and a stale-discovery sweep exists for exactly that (`mqtt.py:184-268`).
