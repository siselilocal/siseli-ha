# release that crash-looped on every start. The failure was a NameError in the
# startup banner, which lived in the `__main__` body that no test executes, in a file
# carrying a ruff F405 exemption -- so neither guard could see it. Only running the
# thing catches that class of fault.

# The Supervisor API is not reachable outside Home Assistant, so bashio::config would
# return null for every option. Configuration is therefore passed as environment
# variables and the Python entrypoint is invoked directly. run.sh is covered instead
# by tests/test_packaging.py, which asserts every option is exported from it.
