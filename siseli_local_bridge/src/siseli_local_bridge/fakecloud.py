"""The MQTT protocol spoken by our impersonated cloud, on top of tcpstack.py.

Reuses the existing decode pipeline unchanged: once a PUBLISH frame's topic and
payload are pulled out of the reassembled byte stream, it goes straight into
SolarParser.parse_payload -- exactly what core.py's passive relay path already does
with payloads reconstructed from a sniffed TCP stream. Only how the bytes were
obtained differs; what they mean does not.

Protocol behaviour is inferred entirely from a real capture of the vendor cloud
(docs/architecture note: dongle_reboot.pcap, 2026-09-11) rather than from any spec
reading, so it only covers what that capture showed: CONNECT/CONNACK, SUBSCRIBE
(one filter, "dtu/<id>/sub/#") /SUBACK, PUBLISH/PUBLISH-reply at QoS 0, PINGREQ/
PINGRESP, DISCONNECT. Anything else (QoS 1/2, retained flag, will messages) is
accepted-and-ignored on the way in and never produced on the way out, because the
capture never exercised it.

The reply-PUBLISH shape is one generic rule, not per-topic special cases: every
inbound "dtu/<id>/pub/<kind>/<name>" the dongle sends gets an ack published to
"dtu/<id>/sub/<kind>/<name>_reply", echoing the envelope's own "c" and "t" fields,
a fresh random "s", "i" one higher than the request's, and "e":0. This one rule
covers dtu_prop_post, dev_prop_post and dev_event_post identically, because the
capture showed all three acked exactly that way with nothing topic-specific in the
reply's shape.

Deliberately not implemented: the periodic dev_rpc poll the real cloud sends every
~26s. The capture shows dev_prop_post already carries the same data on its own
schedule, so the dongle does not structurally need to be asked -- but whether it
tolerates never being asked at all across hours/days of runtime is untested. If
dongles are ever observed reconnecting in a loop or degrading after a long local-
cloud session, start here.
