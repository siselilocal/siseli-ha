"""Blocks the kernel's own sockets from claiming traffic bound for LOCAL_CLOUD_IP.

Home Assistant's local MQTT broker listens on 0.0.0.0:1883, which matches every
local address including LOCAL_CLOUD_IP once that address exists on the interface
(see the network_ip_alias add-on). Without this, the real broker -- not our
userspace fake-cloud responder -- would accept the dongle's connection.

Deliberately narrow: one dedicated nftables table holding a single static INPUT
DROP rule for traffic addressed to this host itself. This is NOT the NAT/FORWARD
approach this project's own history (see CHANGELOG.md, versions 1.6.0-1.8.0) found
unreliable under this base image's kernel -- ip_forward and iptables NAT were
dropped precisely because they lost transit packets meant for a third party (the
real cloud). Nothing here forwards anything to anyone; it only tells the kernel not
to deliver certain locally-destined packets to a locally-bound socket, a different
and much simpler code path.

nft, not legacy iptables: a live install on this add-on's target (6.18-haos-raspi)
showed nf_tables already loaded and in active use by the host (694 references,
likely Docker's own networking) while the legacy ip_tables/iptable_filter modules
could not be loaded inside the container at all (no /lib/modules to modprobe from).
The legacy iptables binary talks to those legacy modules specifically and has no
nf_tables fallback, so it fails outright here; nft speaks nf_tables natively.

raw/PREROUTING, not filter/INPUT: a live test showed Docker itself publishes the
MQTT broker add-on's port 1883 via a DNAT rule in its own `ip nat` table's DOCKER
chain (`iifname != "hassio" tcp dport 1883 ... DNAT`), reached from PREROUTING at
priority dstnat. That hook runs before filter/INPUT in the packet's path, so by the
time a filter/INPUT rule would see the packet its destination address has already
been rewritten to the broker container's bridge IP -- "ip daddr LOCAL_CLOUD_IP"
never matches there no matter how correct the rule is. raw/PREROUTING (priority
"raw", canonically -300) runs before nat/PREROUTING, which is early enough to drop
the packet before Docker's DNAT ever touches it. HAOS's own Supervisor networking
already uses this same raw/PREROUTING hook for its own address protections, visible
in the same `nft list ruleset` output that revealed the DNAT rule in the first
place.
