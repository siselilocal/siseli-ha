"""A minimal HTTP/1.1 server for the dongle's cloud-discovery bootstrap API.

Discovered by capturing a real dongle's traffic (2026-09-12) after fakecloud.py's
MQTT side was already working end-to-end but the dongle kept retrying its identity
announcement (dtu_prop_post) and never progressed to telemetry: the health log
showed repeated failed connections to a THIRD-PARTY host on port 80, which turned
out to be "dtu.access.solar.siseli.com" -- called over plain HTTP, on every boot,
BEFORE the dongle even knows which MQTT broker hostname to resolve. Fully offline
operation needs this answered locally too, or the dongle never learns a broker to
connect to at all.

Three requests were observed, always in this order, over one keep-alive TCP
connection:

  1. POST /dtu/checkin        {"model":..., "firmwareVerCode":..., "firmwareVerText":...}
  2. POST /dtu/devices/findSingle   {"slaveAddr":"","cmdNo":...,"cmdOut":...,"gatherProtocolNo":...,"gatherProtocolVerCode":...}
  3. GET  /dtu/servers/mqtt   -- this response's "data.main.host" is what the dongle
                                 then resolves and connects its MQTT session to.

All three carry `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)` where username and
password are the exact same dtu_id/password pair seen in the MQTT CONNECT
(fakecloud.py's _log_connect) -- not validated here, since this add-on IS the
authority being asked, not a client proving itself to one.

The JSON response bodies below are replayed near-verbatim from that real capture,
against the real vendor cloud, for this exact device. They are not derived from any
spec; anything the dongle does not appear to need for these three calls specifically
was left out or hardcoded rather than guessed at.
