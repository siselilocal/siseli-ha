"""A minimal userspace TCP responder, built on raw L2 send/capture.

Exists because firewall.py's INPUT DROP rule means no normal bind()/listen() socket
can ever see traffic addressed to LOCAL_CLOUD_IP:LOCAL_CLOUD_PORT -- the kernel drops
it before any socket layer runs. The only way left to answer it is to speak just
enough TCP ourselves, the same way core.py already speaks just enough ARP.

Deliberately not a general-purpose TCP stack. What it does not do, on purpose:
  - No out-of-order handling. A segment that does not extend the buffer exactly at
    its expected sequence number is treated as a duplicate: re-ACK the current
    cumulative position, do not touch the buffer. If it was genuinely new data
    arriving early, the peer's own retransmission timer resends it once earlier
    bytes are missing for long enough, and it will then land in order.
  - No congestion control, no window scaling, no SACK. Nothing here ever needs to
    move more than a few hundred bytes per connection.

One Connection per (peer_ip, peer_port); LOCAL_CLOUD_IP:LOCAL_CLOUD_PORT is constant
and implicit.
